                        <li>Smart-Bus is an AmI system that is targeting a specific category of public transports users to help them in their daily usage.</li>
                        <li>Smart-Bus provides information to all users about the bus before it arrives e.g. when will the bus arrive at a given stop, the number of empty seats, temperature and air quality, which allow the users to make a decision either waiting for the bus or searching for another commute solution to reach the destination.</li>
                        <li>For the users who require help to get in the bus like people who use wheelchairs, the system provides them with more options to facilitate their experience by interacting with the bus through an application which allow them to perform the following actions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>They can choose the bus they are going to take and by doing that the system will inform the driver about them so he can take necessary actions to help them if needed.</li>
                                <li>The system will track the location of that special user while he is waiting to make sure he is still waiting for the bus and to use the location for further actions.</li>
                                <li>Before the bus reaches the stop the system will guide the other bus passengers to free the area reserved for wheelchairs by means of a recorded voice message through the bus’s sound system and flashing lights indicating the area that needs to be free to facilitate the process of getting in or off the bus.</li>
                                <li>The system also provides a mechanism to check if the reserved area is freed or not.</li>
                                <li>When the bus reaches the location of the user, a mechanical slider will be extended automatically to allow the wheelchair to get in the bus in a fast, easy and more comfortable way so the driver will not need to leave his driver seat to help unless it’s an emergency.</li>
                                <li>Once they are inside, the system will give them more options e.g. communicate with the driver in case of an emergency, to choose at which stop they will get off the bus so the system initiate preparing for that process by means of another recorded voice message to alert other passengers to free a path to the door and extend the mechanical slider so the wheelchair can get out from the bus to the sidewalk.</li>
